### Introduction
Now-a-days, DC motors are the main mechanism in many devices we use daily, from small gadgets to large machines. This project aims to teach how to build a simple DC motor, helping to understand the basic principles of how these motors work. The main goal is to provide hands-on experience in creating a working DC motor. 

Building the motor from scratch helps link theoretical knowledge to real-world applications, covering areas like material choice, circuit design, and mechanical assembly. This report will guide you through the project step-by-step, explaining how a DC motor works, the materials and components needed, and the building process with clear instructions and pictures. 

Next, the motor is tested to evaluate its performance, measuring speed and discussing results to understand what works well and what could be improved. This project not only teaches about DC motors but also helps build practical skills in electrical engineering.

### Description
 This project demonstrates how to build a simple DC motor from scratch, covering key concepts of electromagnetic principles. It includes step-by-step instructions on materials, assembly, and performance testing. Ideal for hands-on learning in electrical engineering, this project highlights practical applications and offers insights into motor design and functionality.

### Project Objective
- Explore Electromagnetic Basics
- Build a Functional Motor
- Test and Evaluate

### Design
The design of our DC motor incorporates several key components and follows a meticulous process to ensure efficient operation and functionality. This section outlines the design process, detailing each component and its role in the motor’s overall performance.

Initially, we convert AC voltage to DC to power the motor. We design the magnets to generate the necessary magnetic flux, then design the rotor with a two-pole configuration, and finally assemble the commutator and brushes to ensure smooth operation.

#### Components Used for Design
- **SMPS Power Supply**: Converts AC to DC for stable motor operation.
- **AV Meter**: Measures voltage and current during operation.
- **Permanent Magnet**: Creates the magnetic flux for the motor's operation.
- **Enameled Copper Winding Wire**: Forms the rotor windings for efficient current flow.
- **Aluminium Foil**: Used for the commutator to switch current direction.
- **Aluminium Stick**: Acts as brushes for current transfer to the commutator.
